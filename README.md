# Project Infrastructure Setup

## Overview

This repository contains all necessary scripts and configurations for setting up our simulated data center infrastructure using Docker. The `Infrastructure` directory is dedicated to orchestrating the deployment of MongoDB instances across multiple simulated servers and data centers.

For detailed guidance on setting up and managing this Docker-based simulation, refer to the comprehensive documentation available in the [Infrastructure README](./Infrastructure/README.md).

## Quick Start

- **Navigate** to the `Infrastructure` directory.
- **Run** `docker-compose up -d` to start all services.
- **Check** the status of the containers with `docker-compose ps`.

For more details, including how to shut down and clean up the environment, please consult the README in the `Infrastructure` directory.
